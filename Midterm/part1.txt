The CUDA kernel function shown above implements matrix multiplication. It computes the product of two matrices, `X` and `Y`, 
and stores the result in matrix `Z`. Each thread in the CUDA grid is responsible for calculating a single element in the 
resultant matrix `Z` by performing a dot product of the corresponding row from `X` and the column from `Y`. 
The matrix dimensions are assumed to be square, given by the `size` parameter. Each thread identifies its position in the 
output matrix using its block and thread indices, ensuring it computes the correct element.
